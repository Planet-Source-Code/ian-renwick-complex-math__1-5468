## Complex Math


</div>

### Description

Perform functions on complex numbers. Add, subtract, multiply, divide, take logarithms, sines, cosines, tangents, raise one complex number to the power of another. Program has a nice interface allowing the user to see the complex vectors interact. Though written in VB5, it is really an excercise in mathematics. The bas module is where the real meat of the program lies, all the code for the complex number manipulation. The forms are just the 'fluff' for the nice interface. Sorry, the code is not documented at all; just a spur of the moment kind of thing. Any comments or improvements would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Please direct to Soze99@aol.com
